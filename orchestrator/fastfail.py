"""Fast-fail rules for the Nous orchestrator.

Pure functions: take findings, return recommended action for the orchestrator.
The caller is responsible for acting on the returned FastFailAction.

Rules (in priority order):
1. H-main refuted -> caller should skip remaining arms, go to EXTRACTION
2. H-control-negative fails -> caller should return to DESIGN (mechanism confounded)
3. Single dominant component (>80% of total effect) -> caller should SIMPLIFY
4. Otherwise -> CONTINUE normally

Callers must validate findings against findings.schema.json before calling.
