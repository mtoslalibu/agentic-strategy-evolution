# Nous — Hypothesis-Driven Experimentation for Software Systems

Nous is a framework that runs the scientific method on software systems. An AI agent forms a falsifiable hypothesis about system behavior, designs a controlled experiment, executes it, and extracts reusable principles from the outcome — whether the hypothesis was confirmed or refuted.

A deterministic Python orchestrator (not an LLM) drives four AI agent roles through a structured loop, producing schema-governed artifacts at every step. Knowledge compounds: principles from iteration N constrain the design space of iteration N+1.

## Why Nous?

Traditional performance tuning is ad-hoc: try something, measure, repeat. Nous adds structure:

- **Hypothesis bundles** decompose each experiment into multiple falsifiable arms (main hypothesis, ablations, controls, robustness checks) so you learn *why* something works, not just *that* it works.
- **Prediction error taxonomy** classifies wrong predictions by type (direction, magnitude, regime), turning failures into precise knowledge about where your mental model was wrong.
- **Fast-fail rules** cut wasted compute — if the main hypothesis is refuted, skip the remaining arms and go straight to learning.
- **Principle extraction** builds a living knowledge base that prevents the system from repeating mistakes or contradicting established findings.

## When to Use Nous

Nous works on any software system that meets four preconditions:

| Precondition | Example |
|---|---|
| **Observable metrics** | Latency, throughput, error rate, utilization |
| **Controllable policy space** | Algorithms, configurations, scheduling policies, routing rules |
| **Reproducible execution** | Simulator, testbed, or staging environment with controlled conditions |
| **Decomposable mechanisms** | System behavior arises from interacting components you can reason about individually |

**Good fits:** LLM serving systems, database query optimizers, network routing, resource schedulers, caching strategies, load balancers, batch processing pipelines.

**Not a fit:** Systems where you cannot reproduce conditions or measure outcomes quantitatively.

## How It Works

Each iteration follows five phases:

```
1. FRAMING        Planner defines research question, baseline, success criteria
2. DESIGN         Planner creates hypothesis bundle with multiple arms
   DESIGN_REVIEW  AI multi-perspective review (blocks on CRITICAL findings)
   HUMAN_GATE     Human approves, rejects, or aborts
3. RUNNING        Executor implements, runs experiment across 3+ seeds
   FINDINGS_REVIEW AI review of prediction-vs-outcome results
   HUMAN_GATE     Human approves findings
4. TUNING         Bayesian parameter optimization (skipped if H-main refuted)
5. EXTRACTION     Extractor updates principle store (insert/update/prune)
   → next iteration or DONE
```

See [docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md) for the full methodology, [docs/data-model.md](docs/data-model.md) for a plain-English guide to every data structure, and [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for system internals.

## Hypothesis Bundle Arms

Every experiment is structured as a bundle of falsifiable predictions:

| Arm | Question | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **H-main** | Does the mechanism work? | Primary hypothesis with causal explanation |
| **H-ablation** | Which components matter? | Tests individual contribution of each component |
| **H-super-additivity** | Do components interact? | Tests whether compound effect exceeds sum of parts |
| **H-control-negative** | Where should it NOT work? | Confirms mechanism specificity |
| **H-robustness** | Does it generalize? | Tests across workloads, resources, scale |

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Initialize a Campaign

Copy the templates to create a new campaign directory:

```bash
mkdir -p my-campaign/runs
cp templates/state.json my-campaign/
cp templates/ledger.json my-campaign/
cp templates/principles.json my-campaign/
cp templates/campaign.yaml my-campaign/
```

Edit `my-campaign/state.json` to set your `run_id` and `my-campaign/campaign.yaml` to describe your target system, then use the orchestrator engine to drive the state machine:

```python
from orchestrator.engine import Engine

engine = Engine("my-campaign")
print(engine.state)  # {"phase": "INIT", "iteration": 0, ...}

engine.transition("FRAMING")
# ... dispatch agents, run reviews, advance through phases
```

### Run Tests

```bash
pytest -v
```

The full test suite validates schemas, templates, state machine transitions, gates, dispatch, fast-fail rules, protocol conformance, and end-to-end integration.

## Case Study: LLM Inference Serving

Nous was developed and validated through 30 iterations on [BLIS](https://github.com/inference-sim/inference-sim), an LLM inference simulator. The campaign extracted 30 principles across scheduling and routing, achieving a 73.7% reduction in critical TTFT P99 latency.

Key insight: the breakthrough mechanism (SLO-gated admission control) was discovered through *refuted* predictions, not confirmed ones. A direction error in iteration 1 — where priority scheduling caused 62.4% cluster degradation instead of the predicted <10% — redirected the entire investigation toward admission control.

See [docs/case-studies/blis.md](docs/case-studies/blis.md) for the full case study with all 30 extracted principles.

## Current Status

**Phase 1 (current):** Schemas, templates, orchestrator skeleton, and protocol documentation. The orchestrator drives the full state machine with stub agent dispatch, enabling end-to-end testing of the loop without LLM calls.

**Phase 2 (next):** Agent prompts and real LLM dispatch — replacing stubs with actual agent implementations that produce hypothesis bundles, execute experiments, run reviews, and extract principles.
