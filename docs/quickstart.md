# Quickstart

Run a single Nous iteration on any target system.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **An LLM API key** — any [LiteLLM-supported provider](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers). Set the appropriate environment variable (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
- **A target system** — something you can describe in terms of observable metrics and controllable knobs.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI-native-Systems-Research/agentic-strategy-evolution.git
cd agentic-strategy-evolution
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Create a campaign configuration

Create a `campaign.yaml` that describes your target system. See [campaign.schema.yaml](../schemas/campaign.schema.yaml) for the full schema, or use the [BLIS example](../examples/blis/campaign.yaml) as a starting point.

```yaml
research_question: >
  What mechanism drives the primary performance bottleneck in your system?

target_system:
  name: "Your System Name"
  description: >
    What the system does, its architecture, and what you want to investigate.
  observable_metrics:
    - latency_p99_ms
    - throughput_rps
    - error_rate_pct
  controllable_knobs:
    - algorithm
    - cache_size
    - concurrency_limit

review:
  design_perspectives:
    - statistical-rigor
    - causal-sufficiency
    - confound-risk
  findings_perspectives:
    - statistical-rigor
    - causal-sufficiency
    - confound-risk
    - reproducibility
  max_review_rounds: 3

prompts:
  methodology_layer: "prompts/methodology"
  domain_adapter_layer: null
```

### Key fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `research_question` | The guiding question for the campaign — what mechanism are you investigating? |
| `target_system.observable_metrics` | What agents can measure — these appear in predictions and findings |
| `target_system.controllable_knobs` | What agents can change — these define the experimental design space |
| `review.design_perspectives` | How many reviewers check the hypothesis bundle (one per perspective) |
| `review.findings_perspectives` | How many reviewers check the findings (typically more than design) |

## Run a single iteration

```bash
python run_iteration.py campaign.yaml
```

The script handles setup, runs all phases, and pauses at human gates for your approval. Options:

```bash
python run_iteration.py campaign.yaml --model gpt-4o    # different model
python run_iteration.py campaign.yaml --run-id my-run    # custom work dir
python run_iteration.py campaign.yaml -v                 # verbose logging
```

Or try the BLIS example directly:

```bash
python run_iteration.py examples/blis/campaign.yaml
```

## Review output

After completion, check:

- **`runs/iter-1/problem.md`** — How the problem was framed
- **`runs/iter-1/bundle.yaml`** — The hypothesis bundle (validate against `schemas/bundle.schema.yaml`)
- **`runs/iter-1/findings.json`** — Executor findings (validate against `schemas/findings.schema.json`)
- **`runs/iter-1/reviews/`** — All reviewer perspectives
- **`principles.json`** — Extracted principles that guide future iterations

## Choosing a model

By default, `run_iteration.py` uses `aws/claude-opus-4-6`. Pass any [LiteLLM model string](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) via `--model`:

```bash
python run_iteration.py campaign.yaml --model gpt-4o
```

## Phase 2 limitation

The executor currently operates in **analysis mode** — it reasons about the system rather than running actual experiments. Real experiment execution is planned for Phase 3.

## Next steps

- See [examples/blis/](../examples/blis/) for a complete BLIS campaign configuration
- See [docs/architecture.md](architecture.md) for how the orchestrator, dispatcher, and agents fit together
- See [docs/data-model.md](data-model.md) for schema documentation
