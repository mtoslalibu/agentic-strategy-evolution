# Nous Protocol

A domain-agnostic methodology for hypothesis-driven experimentation on software systems using AI agents.

## Overview

Nous is a framework that runs the scientific method on software systems. Two properties make it work:

1. **Hypothesis-driven experimentation** — the agent forms a falsifiable claim, designs a controlled experiment to test it, and learns from the outcome either way. Refuted hypotheses are as valuable as confirmed ones.
2. **Compounding knowledge** — principles extracted from iteration N constrain the design space of iteration N+1. The system gets smarter over time.

The framework consists of a deterministic orchestrator (not an LLM) that drives four AI agent roles through a structured 5-phase loop, producing schema-governed artifacts at each stage.

## Preconditions

All four preconditions must hold for a system to be investigated with Nous:

| Precondition | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Observable metrics** | The system produces measurable outputs (latency, throughput, error rate, utilization). |
| **Controllable policy space** | There are knobs to turn — algorithms, configurations, scheduling policies, routing rules, resource limits. |
| **Reproducible execution** | A simulator, testbed, or staging environment exists with controlled conditions and multiple seeds. |
| **Decomposable mechanisms** | System behavior arises from interacting components that can be reasoned about individually. |

## The 5-Phase Loop

Each iteration follows five phases:

### Phase 1: Problem Framing

The Planner agent writes `problem.md` containing:
- Research question — what mechanism or behavior is under investigation
- Baseline — current system behavior without intervention, with metrics
- Experimental conditions — input characteristics, scale parameters, environment configuration
- Success criteria — quantitative thresholds for success
- Constraints — what cannot be changed (resource limits, SLOs, compatibility)
- Prior knowledge — relevant principles from earlier iterations

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Bundle Design

The Planner agent generates 2–3 candidate strategies, selects a winner via multi-judge review, and decomposes it into a **hypothesis bundle** — a structured set of falsifiable predictions.

A bundle passes through:
1. AI Design Review (default: 5 independent perspectives, configurable per campaign via `campaign.yaml`)
2. Human Approval Gate (hard stop — human sees bundle + review summaries)

If the human rejects, the Planner revises. If approved, the bundle advances to execution.

### Phase 3: Implement and Verify

The Executor agent:
1. Implements the strategy and experiment code for all arms
2. Executes all arms across 3+ seeds
3. Compares predictions to outcomes arm-by-arm
4. Documents results in `findings.json`

Findings pass through:
1. AI Findings Review (default: 10 independent perspectives, configurable per campaign via `campaign.yaml`)
2. Human Approval Gate

The ledger records one row per completed iteration, including prediction accuracy.

### Phase 4: Bayesian Parameter Optimization

For confirmed mechanisms only. The protocol calls for Gaussian process optimization over the parameter space (e.g., 30-50 evaluations per strategy across 3+ seeds). This separates mechanism design (Phase 2) from parameter tuning, ensuring fair comparisons.

If H-main was refuted, this phase is skipped entirely (fast-fail).

### Phase 5: Principle Extraction and Iteration

The Extractor agent updates the principle store:
- **Insert** — add a new principle from confirmed or refuted findings
- **Update** — refine an existing principle's scope, confidence, or parameters
- **Prune** — mark a principle as superseded or refuted by new evidence

Refuted predictions are the most valuable source of principles — they reveal where the model of the system was wrong.

After extraction, the human decides: continue to the next iteration or stop the campaign.

## Hypothesis Bundles

A bundle is a structured set of **arms**, each a *(prediction, mechanism, diagnostic)* triple:

- **Prediction** — a quantitative claim with a measurable success/failure threshold
- **Mechanism** — a causal explanation of how/why the predicted effect occurs
- **Diagnostic** — what to investigate if the prediction is wrong

### Arm Types

| Arm | Tests | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **H-main** | Does the mechanism work, and why? | Primary hypothesis — predicted effect + causal explanation |
| **H-ablation** | Which components matter? | One arm per component — tests individual contribution |
| **H-super-additivity** | Do components interact non-linearly? | Tests whether compound effect exceeds sum of parts |
| **H-control-negative** | Where should the effect vanish? | Confirms mechanism specificity by testing a regime where it should not help |
| **H-robustness** | Does it generalize? | Tests across workloads, resources, and scale |

### Bundle Sizing Rules

| Iteration type | Required arms | Optional |
|---|---|---|
| New compound mechanism (>=2 components) | H-main, all H-ablation, H-super-additivity, H-control-negative | H-robustness |
| Component removal/simplification | H-main, H-control-negative, removal ablation | H-robustness |
| Single-component mechanism | H-main, H-control-negative | H-robustness |
| Parameter-only change | H-main only | — |
| Robustness sweep (post-confirmation) | H-robustness arms only | — |

## Prediction Error Taxonomy

When a prediction is wrong, the error type determines what the system learns:

| Error type | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Direction wrong** | Fundamental misunderstanding of the mechanism | Prune or heavily revise the principle |
| **Magnitude wrong** | Correct mechanism, inaccurate model of strength | Update principle with calibrated bounds |
| **Regime wrong** | Mechanism works under different conditions than predicted | Update principle with correct regime boundaries |

Direction errors are the most serious — they indicate the causal model is fundamentally flawed. Magnitude and regime errors refine understanding without invalidating the mechanism.

## Principle Extraction

The principle store is a living knowledge base. Each principle records:
- **Statement** — what the principle claims
- **Confidence** — low, medium, or high based on evidence strength
- **Regime** — conditions under which the principle holds
- **Evidence** — links to the iterations and arms that established it
- **Mechanism** — the causal explanation underlying the principle
- **Category** — domain (about the target system) or meta (about the investigation process)
- **Status** — active, updated, or pruned

Principles are hard constraints on subsequent iterations. The Planner must not design bundles that contradict active principles without explicit justification.

## Review Protocol

### Multi-Perspective Review

Reviews run N independent perspectives in parallel. Each perspective examines the artifact from a different angle (e.g., statistical rigor, causal sufficiency, confound risk, generalization coverage, mechanism clarity).

### Convergence Gating

Reviews follow a convergence protocol:
1. Run all perspectives in parallel
2. Collect findings with severity levels: CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, SUGGESTION
3. If zero CRITICAL findings: advance to the human gate
4. If any CRITICAL findings: return to the authoring agent for revision
5. Re-run the full review after revision
6. Maximum 10 rounds per gate

SUGGESTION-level items do not block advancement. Only CRITICAL findings block the gate. IMPORTANT findings are surfaced to the human reviewer but do not prevent advancement to the gate.

> **Note:** The perspective counts (5 for design, 10 for findings) and the 10-round maximum are configurable defaults, set per campaign in `campaign.yaml`. The Phase 1 orchestrator skeleton dispatches reviews individually; enforcement of these counts is deferred to Phase 2 (agent prompts).

### Review Gates

| Gate | Perspectives | Reviews | Blocks on |
|---|---|---|---|
| Design Review | 5 (default) | After bundle design | Any CRITICAL finding |
| Findings Review | 10 (default) | After experiment execution | Any CRITICAL finding |

## Human Gates

Two hard stops require explicit human approval:

1. **Design Approval** (after Design Review) — the human sees the hypothesis bundle and all review summaries, then approves, rejects, or aborts the campaign.
2. **Findings Approval** (after Findings Review) — the human sees the findings and all review summaries, then approves, rejects, or aborts.

Human gates cannot be bypassed. They are the mechanism by which domain expertise enters the loop.

## Fast-Fail Rules

The orchestrator enforces three rules to avoid wasted work:

1. **H-main refuted** — skip remaining ablation/robustness arms, go directly to Principle Extraction. The mechanism does not work; running more arms is pointless.
2. **H-control-negative fails** — the mechanism is confounded (it produces effects where it should not). Return to Design for a revised bundle.
3. **Single dominant component (>80% of total effect)** — simplify the strategy by dropping minor components. The compound mechanism adds complexity without proportional benefit.

## Stopping Criteria

A campaign stops when:
- Consecutive iterations produce null or marginal results (no new principles extracted)
- The human decides the research question has been sufficiently answered
- The principle store has stabilized (no inserts, updates, or prunes for N iterations)

## Orchestrator

The orchestrator is a Python state machine — NOT an LLM. It owns:
- Phase transitions between 11 states
- Checkpoint/resume via `state.json`
- Agent dispatch (invoke LLM agents with structured prompts)
- Gate logic (pause for human approval)
- Fast-fail enforcement

### State Machine

```
INIT -> FRAMING -> DESIGN -> DESIGN_REVIEW -> HUMAN_DESIGN_GATE
  -> RUNNING -> FINDINGS_REVIEW -> HUMAN_FINDINGS_GATE
  -> TUNING (if H-main confirmed) or EXTRACTION (if refuted)
  -> EXTRACTION -> DESIGN (next iteration) or DONE

Backward/looping transitions:
  DESIGN_REVIEW -> DESIGN         (CRITICAL findings in review)
  HUMAN_DESIGN_GATE -> DESIGN     (human rejects)
  FINDINGS_REVIEW -> RUNNING      (CRITICAL findings in review)
  HUMAN_FINDINGS_GATE -> RUNNING  (human rejects)
  EXTRACTION -> DESIGN            (next iteration, increments counter)
```

### Agent Roles

| Role | Phases | Reads | Writes | Shell |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Planner | Frame, Design | all | `problem.md`, `bundle.yaml` | — |
| Executor | Run, Tune | all | `findings.json`, `results/` | yes |
| Reviewer | Design Review, Findings Review | all | `review-*.md` | — |
| Extractor | Extract | all | `principles.json`, `summary.md` | — |

### File Layout

```
campaign-dir/
  campaign.yaml       — campaign configuration (target system, reviewers, prompts)
  state.json          — investigation checkpoint
  ledger.json         — append-only iteration log
  principles.json     — living principle store
  problem.md          — problem framing
  runs/
    iter-N/
      bundle.yaml     — hypothesis bundle
      findings.json    — prediction vs outcome
      reviews/        — multi-perspective reviews
  trace.jsonl         — observability log
  summary.json        — campaign rollup (generated at end)
```

## Investigation Summary

After each Extraction phase, the Extractor produces a bounded investigation summary. The next iteration's Design prompt receives:
- Research question
- Investigation summary (what's been tried, what principles hold, open questions)
- Last iteration outcome

This keeps agent context at O(summary) regardless of campaign depth. The full ledger remains on disk for audit purposes but is not passed to agents.
