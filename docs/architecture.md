# Architecture

This document describes the internal architecture of the Nous framework: what each component does, how they interact, and the design decisions behind them.

## Design Philosophy

Nous separates **deterministic orchestration** from **AI reasoning**. The orchestrator is a Python state machine — it never calls an LLM. It owns phase transitions, checkpointing, gate enforcement, and fast-fail rules. AI agents are external processes invoked by the orchestrator with structured prompts and schema-governed outputs.

This separation exists because:
- The orchestrator must be auditable and predictable — you need to trust that gates cannot be bypassed, fast-fail rules fire correctly, and state is always recoverable.
- AI agents are stochastic and expensive — isolating them makes the system testable without LLM calls and lets you swap agent implementations without touching control flow.

## Components

### Engine (`orchestrator/engine.py`)

The engine owns the 11-state state machine and checkpoint/resume.

**State machine:**

```
INIT ──▶ FRAMING ──▶ DESIGN ──▶ DESIGN_REVIEW ──▶ HUMAN_DESIGN_GATE
                        ▲            │                    │
                        │            │ (CRITICAL)         │ (reject)
                        └────────────┘                    │
                        ▲                                 │
                        └─────────────────────────────────┘
                                                          │ (approve)
                                                          ▼
         ┌──────────── RUNNING ◀──────────────────────────┘
         │               ▲
         ▼               │ (CRITICAL or reject)
    FINDINGS_REVIEW ─────┘
         │
         ▼
    HUMAN_FINDINGS_GATE
         │
         ├──▶ TUNING ──▶ EXTRACTION ──▶ DONE
         │                    │
         └──▶ EXTRACTION ◀───┘
                    │
                    └──▶ DESIGN  (next iteration, counter increments)
```

**Key behaviors:**
- `transition(to_state)` validates against the transition table, updates the timestamp, and atomically writes `state.json`.
- Iteration counter increments only on the EXTRACTION → DESIGN transition (starting a new iteration). Loopbacks from DESIGN_REVIEW → DESIGN (critical findings) do NOT increment — they are revisions within the same iteration.
- The DONE state is terminal — no transitions out.

**Atomic writes:** State is written to a temporary file, fsynced, then renamed over `state.json`. This prevents data loss if the process crashes mid-write. The in-memory state is only updated after the disk write succeeds, so state never diverges.

### Dispatch (`orchestrator/dispatch.py`)

The dispatcher invokes AI agents by role and phase, passing structured input and writing schema-validated output.

**Agent roles:**

| Role | Invoked During | Produces |
|---|---|---|
| **Planner** | FRAMING, DESIGN | `problem.md`, `bundle.yaml` |
| **Executor** | RUNNING, TUNING | `findings.json`, `results/` |
| **Reviewer** | DESIGN_REVIEW, FINDINGS_REVIEW | `review-*.md` |
| **Extractor** | EXTRACTION | Updated `principles.json` |

**Phase 1 implementation:** `StubDispatcher` produces valid, schema-conformant artifacts without calling any LLM. This enables full end-to-end testing of the orchestrator loop. The stub is designed to be replaced by a real dispatcher that loads prompt templates, calls an LLM API, validates the response against the schema, and writes the output.

**Dispatch interface:**
```python
dispatcher.dispatch(
    role="executor",           # which agent
    phase="run",               # which phase
    output_path=path,          # where to write
    iteration=1,               # current iteration
    h_main_result="CONFIRMED", # optional: control stub behavior
)
```

### Gates (`orchestrator/gates.py`)

Human gates are hard stops that cannot be bypassed. They surface the artifact and review summaries, then wait for a decision.

**Valid decisions:**
- `approve` — advance to the next phase
- `reject` — loop back (HUMAN_DESIGN_GATE → DESIGN, HUMAN_FINDINGS_GATE → RUNNING)
- `abort` — end the campaign

**Testing modes:** `auto_approve=True` or `auto_response="reject"` for deterministic testing without human interaction.

**Where gates appear:**
1. After DESIGN_REVIEW — human sees the hypothesis bundle and all review summaries
2. After FINDINGS_REVIEW — human sees the findings and all review summaries

### Fast-Fail Rules (`orchestrator/fastfail.py`)

Pure functions that examine findings and return a recommended action. The orchestrator decides how to act on the recommendation.

**Rules in priority order:**

| Rule | Trigger | Action | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | H-main refuted | `SKIP_TO_EXTRACTION` | Mechanism doesn't work — running more arms is pointless |
| 2 | H-control-negative refuted | `REDESIGN` | Mechanism is confounded — it produces effects where it shouldn't |
| 3 | Dominant component >80% | `SIMPLIFY` | One component does all the work — drop the others |
| — | None of the above | `CONTINUE` | Proceed normally |

Rule 1 takes priority: if H-main is refuted, the control-negative result doesn't matter.

```
Iteration 1                    Iteration 2                    Iteration N

│  → 2 principles  │          │ Execute          │          │              │
│                  │          │ Extract          │          │              │
│                  │          │  → 1 new,        │          │              │
│                  │          │    1 updated     │          │              │
└──────────────────┘          └──────────────────┘          └──────────────┘

principles.json grows and refines over time:
  iter 1: [P1, P2]
  iter 2: [P1, P2', P3]       (P2 updated, P3 inserted)
  iter 3: [P1, P2', P4]       (P3 pruned, P4 inserted)
```

Principles are hard constraints: the Planner must not design bundles that contradict active principles without explicit justification.

## Schema Contracts

Every artifact exchanged between components is validated against a JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12). This ensures agents produce well-formed output and makes the system testable without LLMs.

| Schema | Format | Governs |
|---|---|---|
| `campaign.schema.yaml` | YAML | Campaign configuration (target system, reviewer panel, prompt layers) |
| `state.schema.json` | JSON | Orchestrator checkpoint (phase, iteration, run_id, config_ref) |
| `bundle.schema.yaml` | YAML | Hypothesis bundles (arms with predictions, mechanisms, diagnostics) |
| `findings.schema.json` | JSON | Prediction-vs-outcome tables with error classification |
| `principles.schema.json` | JSON | Principle store (statement, confidence, regime, evidence, category, status) |
| `ledger.schema.json` | JSON | Append-only iteration log with prediction accuracy and domain metrics |
| `summary.schema.json` | JSON | Campaign rollup (cost, tokens, principles extracted) |
| `trace.schema.json` | JSON | Observability events (LLM calls, state transitions, gate decisions) |

The bundle and campaign schemas use YAML format because they contain free-text fields that are more readable in YAML. All other schemas use JSON.

## Review Protocol

Reviews run N independent perspectives in parallel, each examining the artifact from a different angle (statistical rigor, causal sufficiency, confound risk, generalization, mechanism clarity). The perspective counts (default: 5 for design, 10 for findings) are configurable per campaign via `campaign.yaml`; the Phase 1 orchestrator dispatches reviews individually and enforcement of these counts is deferred to Phase 2 (agent prompts).

**Convergence gating:**
1. Run all perspectives in parallel
2. Collect findings with severity: CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, SUGGESTION
3. Zero CRITICAL → advance to human gate
4. Any CRITICAL → return to authoring agent for revision
5. Re-run full review after revision (max 10 rounds)

SUGGESTION items never block. IMPORTANT items are surfaced to the human reviewer but do not prevent advancement.

| Gate | Perspectives | After |
|---|---|---|
| Design Review | 5 (default) | Bundle design |
| Findings Review | 10 (default) | Experiment execution |

## Prediction Error Taxonomy

When a prediction is wrong, the error type determines what the system learns:

| Error Type | Meaning | System Response |
|---|---|---|
| **Direction** | Mechanism is fundamentally wrong | Prune or heavily revise the principle |
| **Magnitude** | Right mechanism, wrong strength | Update principle with calibrated bounds |
| **Regime** | Works under different conditions | Update principle with correct regime boundaries |

Direction errors are the most serious and most valuable — they reveal where the causal model is fundamentally flawed. In the BLIS case study, a direction error in iteration 1 (predicting <10% degradation, observing 62.4% degradation) redirected the entire scheduling investigation toward admission control.

## Crash Safety and Recovery

The orchestrator is designed for crash-safe operation:

- **Atomic state writes:** `state.json` is written to a temp file, fsynced, then renamed. A crash during write leaves the previous valid state intact.
- **Checkpoint/resume:** The engine loads state from `state.json` on construction. Kill the process at any point and restart — it resumes from the last committed state.
- **Append-only ledger:** `ledger.json` is never rewritten, only appended to. Lost writes lose at most the current row.
- **Idempotent extraction:** The extractor reads the existing `principles.json`, appends new principles, and writes back. Re-running extraction for the same iteration produces a duplicate (detectable by ID) rather than corruption.

## Extending Nous

### Adding a Custom Agent

Replace `StubDispatcher` with a real dispatcher that:
1. Loads a prompt template for the (role, phase) pair
2. Injects context: current principles, prior findings, problem framing
3. Calls an LLM API
4. Validates the response against the relevant schema
5. Writes the validated output to the specified path

The dispatcher interface is role-based: `dispatch(role, phase, output_path=..., **kwargs)`. Your implementation must produce artifacts that pass schema validation — the orchestrator trusts the schema contract, not the content.

### Adding a New Arm Type

1. Add the type to the `enum` in `schemas/bundle.schema.yaml` (arm type) and `schemas/findings.schema.json` (arm_type)
2. Update `orchestrator/fastfail.py` if the new arm type has fast-fail implications
3. Add test cases to `tests/test_schemas.py` and `tests/test_fastfail.py`

### Adding a New Fast-Fail Rule

1. Add a new `FastFailAction` enum value
2. Add the rule to `check_fast_fail()` with appropriate priority ordering
3. Add test cases covering the rule and its interaction with existing rules
